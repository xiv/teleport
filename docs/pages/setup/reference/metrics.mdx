## Teleport Prometheus endpoint

Teleport provides HTTP endpoints for monitoring purposes. They are disabled
by default, but you can enable them using the `--diag-addr` flag to `teleport start`:

```code
$ sudo teleport start --diag-addr=127.0.0.1:3000
```

Now you can see the monitoring information by visiting several endpoints:

- `http://127.0.0.1:3000/metrics` is the list of internal metrics Teleport is
  tracking. It is compatible with [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)
  collectors.
- `http://127.0.0.1:3000/healthz` returns "OK" if the process is healthy or
  `503` otherwise.
- `http://127.0.0.1:3000/readyz` is similar to `/healthz`, but it returns "OK"
  *only after* the node successfully joined the cluster, i.e.it draws the
  difference between "healthy" and "ready".
- `http://127.0.0.1:3000/debug/pprof/` is Golang's standard profiler. It's only
  available when `-d` flag is given in addition to `--diag-addr`
